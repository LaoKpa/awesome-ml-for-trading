## Companies that Have Done It

List of companies that have successfully applied machine learning or deep learning in stock trading.

* [Renaissance Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies) - Probably the most well known and successful hedge fund firm that specializes in systematic trading using quantitative models derived from mathematical and statistical analyses.
* [Numerai](https://numer.ai/) - An A.I hedge fund with crowd sourced algorithms. People can submit algorithm and get paid if it works. See the corporate introduction video [here](https://youtu.be/dhJnt0N497c), and longer interviews with the founder Richard Craib [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-Sg7KhRhU) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-Sg7KhRhU).
* [Alpaca](https://www.alpaca.ai/) - a platform where end users mark their trading entries/exits in the chart, and a deep learning platform figures out the model to detect such patterns. See their video presentation [here](https://youtu.be/FoQKCeDuPiY)
* [Binatix](http://www.binatix.com/) - there's nothing on their website, but you can read their coverage [Introducing Binatix: A Deep Learning Trading Firm That's Already Profitable](https://www.recode.net/2014/9/10/11630724/introducing-binatix-a-deep-learning-trading-firm-thats-already) (actually there's not much information here either).

## Books

* [Advances in Financial Machine Learning](http://a.co/gKz8hpa) - by Marcos Lopez de Prado (2018). This is a very good book describing how machine learning is (supposed to be) used in finance. The [first chapter](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=521087021095126103013122009108119098033054052039028007076097107111067094069091074068054032007059016029043022070095121122119022016038095048036074098066064114066030068061049125122024004103070072091079107084089027065116124122101097090028025105007065020&EXT=pdf) is available online and it outlines the main ideas that will be taught in the rest of the books. This book is probably the first that was written by someone who knows both finance and machine learning subjects very well. The author is an expert in mathematical finance, has written numerous papers on machine learning and supercomputing, and has $13 billion fund under his management. He knows what he's talking about. And in this book, he describes 1) why many failed to apply ML to finance, and 2) what it takes to succeed. And what it takes to succeed is first you must realize that there is no silver bullet, no magic ML model that will put you in the list of billionaires, and what you must do instead is to establish the infrastructure and process to facilitate the creation and development of these models. Don't make the car, make the car factory. And this book will tell you how.
