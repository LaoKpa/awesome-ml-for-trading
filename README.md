## Companies that Have Done It

List of companies that have successfully applied machine learning or deep learning in stock trading.

* [Renaissance Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies) - Probably the most well known and successful hedge fund firm that specializes in systematic trading using quantitative models derived from mathematical and statistical analyses.
* [Numerai](https://numer.ai/) - An A.I hedge fund with crowd sourced algorithms. People can submit algorithm and get paid if it works. See the corporate introduction video [here](https://youtu.be/dhJnt0N497c), and longer interviews with the founder Richard Craib [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-Sg7KhRhU) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY-Sg7KhRhU).
* [Alpaca](https://www.alpaca.ai/) - a platform where end users mark their trading entries/exits in the chart, and a deep learning platform figures out the model to detect such patterns. See their video presentation [here](https://youtu.be/FoQKCeDuPiY)
